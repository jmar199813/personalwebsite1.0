            <p><span style="color: red;">1.</span> Hello, my name is Lorem Ipsum. I started to learn how to code when I was a kid and wanted to add mods to games I was playing, most notably Minecraft and Skyrim.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bio2">
            <p><span style="color: red;">2.</span> I built this website as a personal portfolio page. I had to refresh myself on HTML and CSS. This led me to taking an HTML/CSS course on freeCodeCamp. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="bio3"> 
            <p><span style="color: red;">3.</span> After I took that course, I knew I needed to learn JavaScript, so I started a JavaScript course. This was fine but I didn't really feel like it was helping me build a portfolio, so I stopped part way through and started my own asteroids project and did the research myself to make it work.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bio4">
            <p><span style="color: red;">4.</span> I started to build this asteroids style game as my own personal project. This project was something I was passioante about and I was thinking about it at all hours of the day. It really helped me understand JavaScript more than any course could teach me.</p>
